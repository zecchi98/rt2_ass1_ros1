# First Assignment of the Research Track 2 course (Robotics Engineering / JEMARO, Unige)

#Where should I install the package?
- the folder "rt2_ass1_std" must be inside the folder src of your ros1 workspace 


The package contains more or less the same package from which we developed the assignment. The only differences are:
- There are different service names.
- There is another launcher which will execute only the "user_interface" and the "go_to_point".This launcher will not work alone, it need to be used with the ros2 branch. Informations about how to launch it with ros2 will be explained in the ros2 branch.
